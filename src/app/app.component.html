            <p>This paper investigates whether a projected body and bike following biomechanical symmetry principles can increase presencein a virtual reality (VR) game. The VirZOOM bike was used as a controller and a game was designed for players to have
                a virtual body sitting on a bike, pedalling in sync with their real body. The game was evaluated with 35 participants, measuring results with the Presence and Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaires. In addition, reaction time was measured
                for everygame. Our analysis concluded that the way biomechanical symmetry was implemented didnâ€™t affect simulator sickness, presence, or reaction time.</p>

                    <p>The game used to test the hypotheses was an endless runner style game. 
                    The player rides a bike through a world that is slowly dissolving behind them.
                    The look of the game is a digital world inspired by the movie Tron. To help give the player a feeling that they are part of the game, the virtual body wears a suit that matches the setting of the game.
                    The suit looks like a motorcycle suit, with parts that light up like the bike's wheels. Along the way, there will be positive and negative pick-ups. 
                    Green batteries will give the player more time to escape the dissolving world, while red ones will deduct time.</p>

                        <p>There was not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of hypothesis A.
                            Moreover, hypothesis B and C were rejected, based on a lack of linear correlation between RT and PQ scores, as well as PQ and SSQ scores with and without the body projection.</p>
